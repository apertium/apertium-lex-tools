There are binaries available for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE,
Windows, and macOS. We package both nightly builds and releases.
See https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Installation for more information.
Only build from source if you either want to change this tool's behavior,
or are on a platform we don't yet package for.
